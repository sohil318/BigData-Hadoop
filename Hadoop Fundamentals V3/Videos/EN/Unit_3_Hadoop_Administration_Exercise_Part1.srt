1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,050
I'm going to do the steps

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,310
necessary now to and a new node

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,570
to my cluster originally I downloaded

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,980
the VMware image for the Quick Start edition

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,539
and that was used in the previous
exercise

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,490
that image is going to be my master

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,699
image I merely have

8
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,900
unzipped to a new location

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,820
the image a second time and

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,370
this is going to become my child image
so now I've got

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,340
two images I've gone through the same
process of specifying the password for

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,940
root

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,370
and for biadmin I have booted both

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,780
of my images and since both images were
created from

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,829
the same zip file they have the same

16
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,660
data which means I have

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,320
BigInsights installed on my

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,170
child image now for a node to be added
to a cluster

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,909
it cannot have any BigInsights code
installed on it

20
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,470
that gets created or installed during

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,700
the add node phase so what we're gonna
have to do

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,060
is to correct that and we have

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,820
on this image that you've downloaded on
our

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,290
desktop for biadmin we have this

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,420
Clean Local BI Icon

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,270
and we're just gonna go ahead and
double-click that

27
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,540
and let the system get cleaned out

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,799
so now we have an image that
doesn't have any

29
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,540
BigInsights code on it that we will be
able to then use

30
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,740
to add a new node

31
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,640
to our cluster so I'm gonna go ahead and
double-click this

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,340
I'm going to click enter to continue on

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,450
and this is going to run for a while and
I'm going to

34
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,729
speed this up so that you don't have to
waste all the time

35
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,069
doing this now once

36
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,819
the uninstall takes place you'll note

37
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,200
that we no longer have any icons

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,900
on our desktop referencing BigInsights

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,000
we don't have the start or stop BigInsights components we don't have the

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,930
icon that gets us to the up to the BigInsights console

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,230
since I began with two copies are the
same image they both have the same

42
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,390
hostname

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,800
and I'm going to have to make some
adjustments here on my child image

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,040
opening a command-line logging in

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,110
as root and I'm going to edit

46
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,950
/etc/hosts I'm gonna change my
hostname

47
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,280
to bivm2.ibm.com

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,280
I'll also do that dynamically
hostname

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,470
to bivm2.ibm.com and then we

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,590
will verify that the change took place
it looks like it did

51
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,349
I need to get my IP addresses for both
my child and my master

52
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:21,420
so I open a command line over on my master

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,430
switch to root do do an ifconfig
to get my IP address there

54
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,340
because I need to update the

55
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,510
/etc/hosts file on both systems to
make each

56
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,290
system know about the other one so on the
child side

57
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,970
we'll edit our hosts file do a little bit

58
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,970
copying and pasting and I will make sure
that the /etc file

59
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,750
is correct as far as the host name is
concerned for the child

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,299
and that we are pointing to the master

61
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:05,019
as well save that they will go to the
host side

62
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,409
it will do the same thing we will edit /etc/hosts

63
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,739
 

64
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,479
and make sure that the master image

65
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,479
is aware of the child image

66
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,620
having done this I'll go ahead and exit
out

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,169
of root and I am ready to continue
