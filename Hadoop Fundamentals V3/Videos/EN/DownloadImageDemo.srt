1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,320
in the first exercise

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,810
we ask you to download the 64-bit

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,690
VMWare image that you will use for
future

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,150
exercises and we provide

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,869
a link to the

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,410
QuickStart Edition VMware image that we
want you to use

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,400
you are going to have to login

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,630
with and IBM ID if you do not have

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,579
and IBM ID then you will go through the

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,600
registration process in order to

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,399
acquire one once you have set up

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,890
your IBM ID then

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,850
enter it in as well as the password

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,140
and click the Sign In button this will then
take you

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,910
to a web page where you now have

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,420
access to VMware

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,350
images that you can use

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,439
now please choose

19
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,770
to download the cluster capable

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,790
VMware image and that is because

21
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,880
future exercises will require

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,520
this particular image those future
exercises will not work

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,549
if you download the single node only

24
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,130
VMware image so select it click Continue

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,259
and you will then be asked

26
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,799
some questions about do you want to be
contacted by IBM

27
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,659
you can say yes or no and

28
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,890
it's also going to specify that you have

29
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,009
agreed to the licensing

30
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,719
requirements specified by IBM check
that

31
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,729
and then click the I confirm

32
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,390
push button the I confirm push button
will then

33
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,060
take you to

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,660
the web page where you can actually

35
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,980
download your image and you've got

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,970
several options here if you're running
on a Windows

37
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,110
system then you will select

38
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,280
that you want to download

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,980
the image that is in a VMDK

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,810
format I believe

41
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,269
that the OVF

42
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:56,760
format is for images

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,239
other than then the VMware

44
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,409
and if you'll notice it's in a

45
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:09,129
7z zipped format which means that you
will need to

46
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,959
unzip it probably using

47
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,830
7-zip in order

48
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,629
to get it to a runnable situation so
click

49
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:27,629
download now

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,910
specify whether you are going to allow or
disallow the application

51
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm going to allow it

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,960
and in my particular case

53
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,440
I have already downloaded this
particular image

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,500
but you will then choose to actually
download it

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,860
and once it gets to a hundred percent

56
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,910
then you're ready to use

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,209
something some program to extract

58
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,180
that zip file I'll close this out

59
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,410
and

60
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,630
close out my web

61
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,460
what I'm going to do now

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:35,460
is to bring up

63
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,910
and in my case I have actually
downloaded both

64
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,930
of these images but we will then

65
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,099
use some some program like

66
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:57,599
7-zip my suggestion it's free

67
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:01,129
you can then go ahead and unzip

68
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,409
the file into the

69
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:07,479
various files require required by VMware

70
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,990
and extracted

71
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,530
to whatever particular location you want
and then you can use

72
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,639
the VM Player or if you actually have

73
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,460
VMware Workstation installed you could
use it but you can use VM Player

74
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,699
in order to run the image

75
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:34,530
so after you have

76
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,919
brought up your image go ahead

77
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,139
and power on the virtual machine

78
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:49,139
if you get this message which probably
will just specify that you've copied it

79
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,360
and then it's going to go through

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,360
a boot up process

81
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,110
and eventually you'll be asked to

82
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,110
login you will login with root and the
password

83
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:36,910
is password and then you're going to
specify

84
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,449
your language Press F10

85
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,630
to continue and then you're going to be
stepped through

86
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,280
a variety of panels

87
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,190
that are going to list out the licensing
agreements

88
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,940
and just click Enter to

89
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,389
indicate that you understand and that
you accept once again you're going to be

90
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,789
asked for

91
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:16,039
the password for root now this allows
you to change root's password

92
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,210
please be aware that we assume

93
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,570
in our exercise instructions

94
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,340
that the password for root is still
password

95
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,310
and then you will reconfirm it

96
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,599
the password

97
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,009
for biadmin we assume

98
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:48,009
is biadmin

99
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,530
and then your system will go through the
process

100
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,870
of booting up and everything will

101
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,810
be ready for you start doing your
exercises
