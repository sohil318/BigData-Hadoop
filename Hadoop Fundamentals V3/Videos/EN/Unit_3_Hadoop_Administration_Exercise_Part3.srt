1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,710
and so now let's look at checking the
health of our system

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,139
a real easy way of doing this is through
the

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:14,490
BigInsights console you know we can
take a look at all the components see

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,960
whether they're running or not

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,090
we can take a look at our nodes see if
they're running or not matter of fact

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,750
for example by clicking on MapReduce we
can go in and we can start or stop

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,670
task trackers from HDFS we can go in

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,960
and start or stop data nodes thing like
Big SQL

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,530
we can actually start or stop Big SQL

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,930
and then there's the

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,770
command line one of the things that

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,949
you might want to do is check and see
how much space is available

13
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:55,920
on each of your nodes so if you execute

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,030
hadoop dfsadmin -report

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,730
it will come back with

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:10,730
a report on each the nodes now if you'll
notice

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,270
we still have node bivm3 there

18
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,680
but it's been decommissioned but for the
other nodes you can see how much space

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,909
has been used

20
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,000
what percentage is remaining and
something that you ought to check on

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,960
periodically

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,470
we just looked

23
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,770
at starting and stopping components
using the

24
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,250
BigInsights console you can also do
that

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,659
from the command line now initially we
started

26
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,180
all of the components from the command line
but you can start and stop individual

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,799
components for example like

28
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:57,399
Hadoop and Oozie or

29
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:04,399
Hadoop and the console

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,660
and then you

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,760
also need to be able

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,830
or be aware of making
modifications

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,350
to the parameters

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,750
that Hadoop uses

35
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,350
and those parameters in BigInsights are
found in

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,410
underneath the /home/hdm/hadoop-conf-staging

37
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,270
 

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,150
we make changes to these

39
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,530
staging files here's the hdfs-site

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,510
here's the core-site and somewhere
on here

41
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,280
is the there it is the map reduce the
mapred-site

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,290
files that had the various
parameters in there for those different

43
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,040
components

44
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,080
if we edit hdfs-site.xml

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,180
we can see the

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,860
the different parameters that we can
make changes to here's

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,620
dfs-blocksize you want to change that from the

48
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,340
128 megabytes that BigInsights defaults
to

49
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:27,680
Hadoop defaults to 64 scroll down we see
here's our

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,860
dfs-replication it's been set to a value
of 2

51
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,690
well that's because we've got two data nodes
and if we scroll further on down we can

52
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,310
find the

53
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,960
the

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,630
dfs.datanode.du.reserved
you know how much space we're going to

55
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,590
maintain

56
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,590
for other systems now when you make
changes to any of these

57
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,610
configuration files once again these
are

58
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,060
in the staging directory you need to
then

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,600
go to the $BIGINSIGHTS/bin
directory

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,940
and you execute the sink configuration
or the sink.conf

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,430
script and this will then push those
changes out to

62
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,310
all of the nodes
