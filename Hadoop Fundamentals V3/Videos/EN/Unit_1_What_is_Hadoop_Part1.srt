Hello everyone and welcome to Hadoop Fundamentals
– What is

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:11,670
Hadoop. My name is Warren Pettit.
In this video we will explain what is Hadoop

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,490
and what is Big Data.
We will define some Hadoop-related open source

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,830
projects and give
some examples of Hadoop in action.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:30,720
Imagine this scenario: You have 1GB of data
that you need to process.

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,260
The data is stored in a relational database
on your desktop computer and

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,690
this desktop computer has no problem handling
this load.

8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,760
Then your company starts growing very quickly,
and that data grows to

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,980
10GB.
And then 100GB.

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,850
And you start to reach the limits of your
current desktop computer.

11
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,540
So you scale-up by investing in a larger computer,
and you are then OK

12
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:10,540
for a few more months.
When your data grows to 10TB, and then 100TB,

13
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,010
you are quickly
approaching the limits of that computer.

14
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:21,690
Moreover, you are now asked to feed your application
with unstructured

15
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:27,870
data coming from sources like Facebook, Twitter,
RFID readers,

16
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:34,870
sensors, and so on.
Your management wants to derive information

17
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,090
from both the relational
data and the unstructured data and wants this

18
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,630
information as soon as
possible.

19
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:50,630
What should you do? Hadoop may be the answer!
What is Hadoop?

20
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,020
Hadoop is an open source project of the Apache
Foundation.

21
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,600
It is a framework written in Java originally
developed by Doug Cutting

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,600
who named it after his son's toy elephant.
Hadoop uses Google’s MapReduce and Google

23
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:15,870
File System
technologies as its foundation.

24
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,620
It is optimized to handle massive quantities
of data which could be

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,230
structured, unstructured or semi-structured,
using commodity hardware,

26
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,230
that is, relatively inexpensive computers.
This massive parallel processing is done with

27
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,900
great performance.
Hadoop replicates its data across multiple

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,900
computers, so that if one goes
down, the data is processed on one of the

29
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,689
replicated computers.
It is a batch operation handling massive quantities

30
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:56,629
of data, so the
response time is not immediate.

31
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:01,409
Hadoop is not suitable for OnLine Transaction
Processing workloads

32
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,620
where data is randomly accessed on structured
data like a relational

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,590
database.
Also, Hadoop is not suitable for OnLine Analytical

34
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,559
Processing or
Decision Support System workloads where data

35
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:21,529
is sequentially accessed
on structured data like a relational database,

36
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:27,989
to generate
reports that provide business intelligence.

37
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:34,109
As of Hadoop version 2.2, updates are not
possible, but appends are

38
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:40,129
possible.
Hadoop is used for Big Data. It complements

39
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,609
OnLine Transaction
Processing and OnLine Analytical Processing.

40
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:50,999
It is NOT a replacement for a relational database
system.

41
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:57,099
So, what is Big Data?
With all the devices available today to collect

42
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:02,989
data, such as RFID
readers, microphones, cameras, sensors, and

43
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:09,989
so on, we are seeing an
explosion in data being collected worldwide.

44
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:14,859
Big Data is a term used to describe large
collections of data (also known

45
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:20,049
as datasets) that may be unstructured, and
grow so large and quickly that

46
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:25,560
it is difficult to manage with regular database
or statistical tools.

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,530
Other interesting statistics providing examples
of this data explosion are:

48
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:38,530
There are more than 2 billion internet users
in the world today,

49
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:45,539
and in 2014 there will be 7.3 billion active
cell phones.

50
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:53,530
Twitter processes 7TB of data every day, and
500TB of data is

51
00:04:54,379 --> 00:05:01,379
processed by Facebook every day.
Interestingly, approximately 80% of these

52
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:09,129
data are unstructured.
With this massive quantity of data, businesses

53
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:13,479
need fast, reliable, deeper
data insight.

54
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,770
Therefore, Big Data solutions based on Hadoop
and other analytics

55
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,830
software are becoming more and more relevant.
