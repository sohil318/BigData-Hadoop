Welcome to the unit on Hadoop Administration.
The agenda covers adding nodes to a cluster,

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,820
verifying the health of a cluster, and stopping
/

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,720
starting components. Then the unit covers
configuring Hadoop and setting up rack topology.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,580
Let’s begin with adding and removing nodes
from a cluster.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,730
Adding nodes can be performed from the BigInsights
Console or the command line. To do so

6
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,410
requires either the ip address or hostname
of the node to be added. The node to be added

7
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,500
must
also be reachable. And as a matter of fact,

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,219
it works both ways. The master and child nodes
must

9
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:51,390
all be able to communicate with each other.
In this case, a child node refers to the node

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,719
that is
being added. It may not have BigInsights already

11
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,180
installed on it. When the node is added to
a

12
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:06,180
cluster, the BigInsights code is transferred
to the new node and installed.

13
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:13,310
From the BigInsights Console you use the Cluster
Status tab and, on the left side, select Nodes.

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,440
You then click the Add nodes pushbutton.
You are then presented with a dialog that

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,330
allows you to specify one or more nodes to
be added.

16
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:30,330
You may type in ip address, hostnames or any
combination thereof. You can even specify

17
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,220
an
ipaddress range or a regular expression with

18
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:41,220
your hostname. In the example, child5.ibm.com,
child6.ibm.com, etc would be added.

19
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:53,229
Once the nodes have been added, you define
which services are to be hosted on those nodes.

20
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,920
You
can select multiple services for one or more

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,470
nodes.
Services can also be removed from a node.

22
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,500
As a matter of fact, if you are using the
BigInsights

23
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,880
Console to remove a node, you must first remove
all services from that node. Depending on

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,880
which services are running on a node, you
select which are to be removed.

25
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,590
When there are no services running on a node,
it can be removed using the BigInsights Console.

26
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,840
All that we just said about adding and removing
nodes can also be done from the command line.

27
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,840
You use the addnode.sh script to add one or
more nodes. Once again, either ipaddresses

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,030
or
hostname can be specified. You also specify

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,630
which services are to run on the new nodes.
In the

30
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,040
example, the hadoop service was specified.
This means that the node will be used for

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,350
a
DataNode and TaskTracker.

32
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,490
Listnode.sh displays all of the nodes in the
cluster and which services are running on

33
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,770
those
nodes.

34
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:12,770
You can remove a service from a node using
the removenode.sh script and you can remove

35
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,430
a
node using that same script. In this case,

36
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:25,430
you can remove a node even though it has services
running. Maybe not the best idea, but it is

37
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,010
doable. At least you are prompted whether
to

38
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,700
continue.
Next let us discuss verifying the heath of

39
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,340
your cluster. You are able to view all of
the nodes in

40
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,340
the cluster, see the status of each node and
which services are running on each node.

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:54,180
From the command line you can run the DFS
Disk Check report . This lets you see how

42
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,510
much
space is still available on each DataNode.

43
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:05,510
Next let us look at start and stopping components
and services.

44
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,530
You may in order to save some resources, you
only want to start a subset of the Hadoop

45
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:21,530
components . From the command line you can
run the start.sh script and specify one or

46
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,490
more
components that are to be started. If you

47
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,470
want to start all components, then you can
execute startall.

48
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:37,470
sh. Likewise, you can stop a subset of running
components and if you want stop all

49
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:46,310
components, execute stop-all.sh.
You also have the option of starting and stopping

50
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,060
components using the BigInsights Console.
Please continue to the next part of this presentation.
