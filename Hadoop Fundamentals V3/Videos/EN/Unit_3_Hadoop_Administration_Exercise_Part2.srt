1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,060
so let's continue with adding a node to
a cluster

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,240
and after we've updated our

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,480
/etc/hosts files let's make sure
that we actually do have

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,500
connectivity so I'm going to execute

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,220
ssh and I'm going to log onto

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,230
bivm2 as root entered in my password

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,330
and everything went

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,480
okay I'll exit out of there so now I
know I've got connectivity

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,320
and we will

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,320
need to start our BigInsights
components at this point now

11
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,020
you can click on the icon on the desktop

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,930
but that only comes with this QuickStart
image

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,430
in real life you won't have that icon on
the desktop

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,829
if you install the software so let's do
it the old fashion way

15
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,570
and from a command line we're going to
execute

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:09,010
start-all script that's in the $BIGINSIGHTS_HOME/bin directory

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,270
and this is going to go through the process
of

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,310
starting the various components

19
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,900
for BigInsights we're not going to

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,229
waste a lot of time

21
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:29,229
well we'll speed this up let me put it that
way and once

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,200
we get everything started we will go ahead
and get rid of that window

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,520
and now I will start the web console

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,130
I'm going to use initially the web console to

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:49,130
add our new node I'm going to log in as biadmin

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,440
initially we are taken to the welcome

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,020
page we'll move to the cluster status

28
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:10,020
and here we can see that we have a
couple about our components that are not

29
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,730
running right now

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,220
and it just may be that

31
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,110
we hit it too soon there you go

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,240
HBase just started running but we only
have one node

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,700
that's the bivm.ibm.com

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,730
so let's add a new node I'm going to

35
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,810
type in the hostname I could have typed
in the IP address I could have typed in

36
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,520
a range of IP addresses

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,790
type in the password for root

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,880
on the bivm2 system

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,550
and the first they were going to do is try
to make sure that we have connectivity

40
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,989
and yes the master is able to get

41
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,040
in touch with that child so now

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,260
we know about the node

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,340
we need to add services to the node. We're
only going to choose the

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,420
DataNode/TaskTracker

45
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,030
on our new node this normally runs

46
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,000
a while I'm not going to put you through
that pain

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,530
if you're doing it in lab exercise you
will experience it

48
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,090
and here we have a successful operation

49
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,630
we can now see that bivm2

50
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,769
is running and its running as a data

51
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:38,180
node and task tracker what about

52
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,620
adding a new node via the command
line

53
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,250
I have gone through the process of
setting up a third

54
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,720
VMWare image and

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,470
you can see I have called it bivm3
went through the same process that we

56
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,530
showed earlier when setting up bivm2

57
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,690
and I did my SSH and all those things

58
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,520
now what we're going to do is change to

59
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,840
$BIGINSIGHTS_HOME/bin directory

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,209
and we'll

61
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,060
execute the add node script

62
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,840
now we have to specify the component in
our case it's gonna be Hadoop that means

63
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,010
task tracker and a

64
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,020
data node and we specify

65
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,750
the hostname or IP address

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,520
and then a comma and then the password for root

67
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,789
on that other system in my case the
password was password

68
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,300
now it's going through the process

69
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,650
of installing the code

70
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,950
on bivm3 but again not going to put
you through

71
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,099
the entire time that it took to do that
but you can see that

72
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:01,510
we had some success there we go back to
the

73
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,190
web console login

74
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,849
we should now see that we have three
nodes

75
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:14,630
in an our cluster and we do

76
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,530
bivm3 is also running as a data
node in the task tracker

77
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,169
what about removing a node

78
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,460
it is possible to remove a node using
the

79
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,510
the graphical interface but we're going to
go ahead just do it from a command line

80
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,930
I'm going to

81
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,289
close this window and open a new

82
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:37,320
command line window didn't have to do
but I just thought

83
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,080
it would be nice if we had a fresh window
without a

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,729
lot of extraneous information there I'm
going to change to the

85
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:51,780
bin directory for BigInsights again and
now I'm going to execute the removenode

86
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,500
 

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,919
script I need to specify

88
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,930
the hostname or IP address

89
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,210
and also going to specify the -f

90
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,570
command which says force because we
possibly can have

91
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,560
files in which part the replication is
now on bivm3

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,280
and what we're saying is we're aware
that

93
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,729
and we may end up with some files
that

94
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:24,470
don't have all of the replicas

95
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,500
that Hadoop would like

96
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,290
and so we go through the process of 
removing the node and we can see that

97
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,600
we had success

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,889
we can verify this by doing a

99
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:47,889
listnode

100
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,940
and we see you there bivm and bivm2

101
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,290
are the nodes in our system
