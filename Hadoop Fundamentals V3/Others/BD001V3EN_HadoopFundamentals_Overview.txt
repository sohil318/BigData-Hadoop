Hadoop Fundamentals V3

This course is designed to give you a basic understanding of Hadoop.  If first begins with
describing what is Big Data and the need for Hadoop to be able to process that data in a 
timely manner. This is followed by describing the Hadoop architecture and how to work with 
the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) both from the command line and using the BigInsights
Console that is supplied with InfoSphere BigInsights.

After describing Hadoop's architecture, Hadoop administration is covered. Here the course 
covers adding and removing nodes from a Hadoop cluster, checking the amount of disk space 
available on each node, and how to modify the various Hadoop configuration parameters. 

The course ends with overviews of some of the other open source products using in a Hadoop 
cluster. Only highlights are given about MapReduce, Pig, Jaql, Hive, Flume, Sqoop, and Oozie.
There are other courses on the Big Data University that cover these products in more detail.
